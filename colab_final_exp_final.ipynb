It could simply be that you are feeling overwhelmed or bogged down by your current workload and responsibilities.

If any of these is the case, it might be helpful to talk to your supervisor or manager to see if there is anything that can be done to make the situation more manageable.

Obviously, it\\u2019s their job to listen and what not, but it\\u2019s such a new thing for me to have someone listen and understand!! I have normal relationships and what not, but I don\\u2019t talk about what\\u2019s going on in my life. And well, like I said, this therapist, he listens!! And I don\\u2019t know how it started, but now I\\u2019m attracted to him and think about him all the time. Yikes! And I had therapy the other day and I was feeling a bit awkward sometimes because in my head I was thinking about him sexually!! And he was right there in front of me. Not good but so good at the same time! But yeah nothing will happen anyway because 1. he\\u2019s my therapist and that goes against code and 2. he\\u2019s married anyway. But it doesn\\u2019t stop me from thinking about him that way. I don\\u2019t know if I have control over my actions but don\\u2019t want to lose him as a therapist! And if I ask him for help about it, I guess I probably will. I can\\u2019t ask anyway\\u2026 too awkward. And I don\\u2019t want to start again with a new therapist. So please give me some ideas! Oh, and if this helps in anyway, I have bipolar\\u2026. but I guess I\\u2019m not the first person in the world to be attracted to my therapist so maybe it doesn\\u2019t! (18 year old female who recently started therapy)\",\n          \"My best friend had a terrible car accident 4 months ago with serious brain damage and head injuries, all the doctors said he would not make it, they said they are only waiting for him to die or stay in coma, and that there is nothing left to do. At that time i was absolutely devastated and had a really hard time. He was in a coma for about a month, however after a few successful surgeries he started waking up, and against all odds he survived. Injuries he suffered were great, but now, after 4 months, he is slowly recovering, he learned how to walk again, he recognizes his family and me, his long-term memory is more or less ok. However, his short-term memory is pretty bad, and because of the accident he cant open his eyes, and it is not sure whether he will be able to see again in his life. We are best friends from college, I live in Slovakia, he lives in Czech republic, so we were able to see each other only when in school, but we were always together, whether in school or when we were going out to bars etc. He is recovering in Czech republic, I am currently living in Slovakia, so I cannot see him that often. The problem is, i thought i got use to the fact that he is no longer going to school with me and that I am not seeing him regularly. However, he likes to talk on the phone (of course he is confused some times), and whenever his family calls me and I talk to them and to him, I start to shiver, shake, suddenly I am feeling cold and it takes my body about half an hour to relax. This is nothing serious, but I thought I am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better. But just a few days ago, when his family called me (after nearly a month or so), I immediately started to shake and experience these feelings again. I would like to know what to do, or how to get over this anxiety, i want to be helpful to my friend, and not feel this weak whenever I talk to him. Thank you\",\n          \"I will try and establish all of my issues directly; I am currently seeing a therapist, who I frequently lie to. 1) I cannot sleep through the night and subsequently spend all day and most of the night on the Internet. Once I get to sleep I will sleep until midday. 2) I have a very big sexual appetite that no one is able to fill. I speak with a multitude of women online and love the detachment, I treat them badly. Say sexually explicit things and enjoy that. I then turn it on them. I enjoy that. It makes me laugh a lot. Pathetic and desperate dumb bitches. 3) I am no longer employed. 4) I live at home with my father. Parents have been divorced for years. I believe this is why I never want to get married. 5) I have an extreme fear of commitment and insist on sexual relationships that do not include kissing or hugging (anything remotely emotional) 6) I am highly intelligent. I tell people that I am better than them. However I really hate myself, I frequently consider suicide. 7) I have come from a wealthy upbringing, however expectations are unreal. 8) I have very few friends. I spend a lot of time alone. Going out with family is something I cannot be bothered to do. 9) I am bored, feel nothing excepting extreme anger, frustration and guilt. 10) I have done morally representable things. 11) I have no issue fighting and making others feel bad. Until I feel guilt for it. 12) I smoke, but do not drink heavily nor do drugs at all. 13) I was bullied when I was in school 14) I feel alone. I rode my motorcycle to feel the rush, it was fun. Then I crashed it and couldn\\u2019t get it fixed. 15) I have no one to turn to, and am constantly emotionally and physically alone. 16) I think highly of my sister and my brother. She is caring he is not. 17) My mother has always been distant. That is why I \\u2018love\\u2019 dad.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5311,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have significant difficulties with social interactions, social information processing and OCD-like repetitive interests and behaviors. These difficulties can significantly impair the quality of one\\u2019s life.The difficulties you\\u2019re facing are common among adults with autism spectrum disorders. You should consult a mental health professional who specializes in adult autistic spectrum disorders. If possible, choose a therapist who is familiar with cognitive enhancement therapy (CET). CET is a relatively new treatment that trains individuals with autism spectrum disorders to have more positive social interactions. They do this by teaching individuals, among other things, how to identify social cues, how to take the perspective of another person and how to properly respond in a one-on-one conversation.If a CET-trained professional is not available, choose a therapist who has experience working with clients with problems similar to yours.If you have not done so already, consult a psychiatrist about your obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Medication could help you to better manage your symptoms. Please take care.\",\n          \"I understand why you are frustrated. Give yourself credit for wanting to respond to your friends\\u2019 feedback even though it was probably difficult to hear.I suggest a couple of things: First, do check with other friends to see if they agree that you sound patronizing. It\\u2019s just possible that the two friends who talked to you are particularly sensitive to tone of voice and that others don\\u2019t agree.If most of your friends and family generally agree that you do sound condescending, choose someone you especially trust and ask them to imitate what they hear when you speak to them so you can better understand what they are talking about. Then role play different ways to say the same thing until you both agree that you have found a correction. Practice will bring how you speak in line with what you intend to say.I wish you well. \",\n          \" I am very glad you are writing us and asking your question.

You are obviously a good student, and the school counselor will be able to help you bring some of these anxieties under control. The first thing to do is talk about it with someone you trust.

Thanks again for having the courage to write to \\u201cAsk the Therapist.\\u201dTake good care of yourself!Julie Hanks, LCSW\",\n          \" Your anxiety associated with your injured friend does not make you weak. That line of thinking is problematic because it reinforces the all too common narrative that psychological distress is a sign of weakness, shame and embarrassment. To be shaken by the trauma of your friend makes you human and it shows that you care. Someone you deeply care about was severely injured in a serious accident. It was unexpected and proof that our lives can change in an instant. Psychologically, that realization can be difficult to manage.Your symptoms may be indicative of secondary trauma. Secondary trauma involves an indirect exposure to trauma through hearing the first-hand account or narrative of a traumatic event. Simply hearing about the traumatic event can cause symptoms and reactions that are very similar to or even mimic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatments for secondary trauma often involves sharing the story of what happened and talk therapy.It would be helpful to learn more about compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma and self-care. Books on the subject can educate you about day-to-day activities that may help to relieve your stress. I would also recommend counseling for learning relaxation and other techniques to assist with your anxious reactions. Choose a therapist who specializes in trauma survivors. You may only need a few sessions to decrease your symptoms. Good luck. Please take care.\",\n          \" I believe that you are referring to your inner, conscious voice. We all have an inner, conscious voice. It may be our intuition or a running stream of consciousness. It\\u2019s normal to hear an inner voice.Your inner voice is filled with negativity. People with low self-esteem and feelings of low self-worth describe their inner voices as being negative. People with depression also describe experiencing a great deal of negative self-talk. They seem to interpret all of their experiences as being negative.Now that you are aware of your negative self-talk, you can attempt to challenge the validity of your thoughts. Negative self-talk tends to be inaccurate and exaggerated.For instance, your inner voice says that your friends \\u201chate you\\u201d but what evidence do you have to support that belief? I suspect that there is little or no evidence to support your belief. Your boyfriend has been with you for four years yet you believe he doesn\\u2019t love you. If that\\u2019s the case, then why hasn\\u2019t he ended the relationship?Your trust issues may sabotage the relationship and thus you should consider psychotherapy. Depression, negative self-talk, feelings of low self-worth, and relationship issues are some of the most common reasons people enter therapy. I hope that you will consider my advice. Try counseling, I think that you\\u2019ll be glad you did. Please take care.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I hear that you are afraid of losing this relationship if you disclose your feelings to your therapist and that you\\u2019ll have to start all over.\\u00a0 Assuming your therapist is skilled and experienced, he will be able to help you work through this attraction.\\u00a0 Start slow in sharing your feelings. Let him know that you\\u2019re scared to share these feelings and that you want help to understand what they really mean.\\u00a0 When sharing your transference with your therapist, remember that your feelings are information about your deeper emotional longings, wounds, and needs, and are not about your actual relationship with your therapist.

That line of thinking is problematic because it reinforces the all too common narrative that psychological distress is a sign of weakness, shame and embarrassment. To be shaken by the trauma of your friend makes you human and it shows that you care. Someone you deeply care about was severely injured in a serious accident. It was unexpected and proof that our lives can change in an instant. Psychologically, that realization can be difficult to manage.Your symptoms may be indicative of secondary trauma. Secondary trauma involves an indirect exposure to trauma through hearing the first-hand account or narrative of a traumatic event. Simply hearing about the traumatic event can cause symptoms and reactions that are very similar to or even mimic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatments for secondary trauma often involves sharing the story of what happened and talk therapy.It would be helpful to learn more about compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma and self-care. Books on the subject can educate you about day-to-day activities that may help to relieve your stress. I would also recommend counseling for learning relaxation and other techniques to assist with your anxious reactions. Choose a therapist who specializes in trauma survivors. You may only need a few sessions to decrease your symptoms. Good luck. Please take care.\",\n          \" I believe that you are referring to your inner, conscious voice. We all have an inner, conscious voice. It may be our intuition or a running stream of consciousness. It\\u2019s normal to hear an inner voice.Your inner voice is filled with negativity. People with low self-esteem and feelings of low self-worth describe their inner voices as being negative. People with depression also describe experiencing a great deal of negative self-talk. They seem to interpret all of their experiences as being negative.Now that you are aware of your negative self-talk, you can attempt to challenge the validity of your thoughts. Negative self-talk tends to be inaccurate and exaggerated.For instance, your inner voice says that your friends \\u201chate you\\u201d but what evidence do you have to support that belief? I suspect that there is little or no evidence to support your belief. Your boyfriend has been with you for four years yet you believe he doesn\\u2019t love you. If that\\u2019s the case, then why hasn\\u2019t he ended the relationship?Your trust issues may sabotage the relationship and thus you should consider psychotherapy. Depression, negative self-talk, feelings of low self-worth, and relationship issues are some of the most common reasons people enter therapy. I hope that you will consider my advice. Try counseling, I think that you\\u2019ll be glad you did. Please take care.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It will not always be that way. It is important to keep remembering that.Feeling depressed makes sense in light of your recent breakup and your difficulty with friends. Many people would feel the way that you do, especially if they had no one to confide in. I would encourage you to speak to your family. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. Everyone has experienced difficult times in their lives.If you feel that you cannot speak to your family, then consider going to the school guidance counselor or seeing a therapist. The latter option would likely require you to inform your parents about your depression. Many teenagers are frightened to ask their parents to see a therapist but they shouldn\\u2019t be. If you developed an unfamiliar rash, or a terrible cough, would you feel embarrassed about asking your parents to take you to a doctor? Probably not. The same logic applies to mental health problems.Parents often want to help but can\\u2019t when they don\\u2019t know that a problem exists. It is important that one asks for help when it is needed. Otherwise, the risk is prolonged and unnecessary suffering takes place. Don\\u2019t hesitate to ask for help. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.\",\n          \" I don\\u2019t know how your low opinion of yourself got started but it certainly has taken on a life of its own. You are ruminating.

By repeatedly telling yourself what a worthless person you are, you are reinforcing your sense of your own worthlessness.Enough. You don\\u2019t have to do that. Since you do know that things you do are \\u201cstupid and mean,\\u201d you aren\\u2019t psychotic. You do know that you are stuck in negativity and you do know the difference between right and wrong. The fact you are ignoring is that you are choosing the life you have. Because it is a choice, you can choose a different path.Since you haven\\u2019t been able to pull yourself out of this hole on your own, I hope you will make an appointment with a therapist. Therapy will help you stop the ruminating and start to put a better life in motion. Cognitive-Behavior Therapy would probably be the most helpful.Writing to us here at PsychCentral was a very good start. It shows that you haven\\u2019t really given up on yourself. Take that little indication of self-respect another step. Get yourself the help you need and, yes, deserve.I wish you well. \",\n          \" You are not to blame for your father\\u2019s unfortunate and sad choice. A fight with a daughter is not enough for a person to end his own life. My guess is that he was dealing with a great many things and felt helpless to change them.Often people like those in your family blame someone because it is just too, too hard to accept that they didn\\u2019t see it coming and they hadn\\u2019t helped. When a tragedy happens, people cast about for a way to make sense of it. They may not, in fact, have had any more to do with your dad\\u2019s suicide than you did, but they may be fending off feelings of responsibility and self-blame by blaming you.I suggest you contact a women\\u2019s center. Often women\\u2019s centers have a resource and referral office that helps people connect with services they need. The center itself may have support groups running. Another avenue for support is the communities of faith in your area. It may be that one of the religious leaders is open to providing counseling for someone who can\\u2019t afford to pay for therapy. Sometimes hospitals offer grief groups too. When I did a web search for grief groups in your area, I found quite a few. Ask your doctor if she or he knows of any services as well.I hope you find a group. The support of other people who know how you feel will give you some relief. Eventually, I hope the family gets some family therapy so they can stop making you the focus of their grief and you can feel comfortable in family gatherings.I wish you well. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

probably not. the same logic applies to mental health problems.parents often want to help but can\\u2019t when they don\\u2019t know that a problem exists. it is important that one asks for help when it is needed. otherwise, the risk is prolonged and unnecessary suffering takes place. don\\u2019t hesitate to ask for help. i wish you the best of luck. please take care.\",\n          \"i don\\u2019t know how your low opinion of yourself got started but it certainly has taken on a life of its own. you are ruminating. that means that you are going over and over and over and over how inadequate you are. like water moving over a stone, the repetition is wearing you down and out. by repeatedly telling yourself what a worthless person you are, you are reinforcing your sense of your own worthlessness.enough. you don\\u2019t have to do that. since you do know that things you do are \\u201cstupid and mean,\\u201d you aren\\u2019t psychotic. you do know that you are stuck in negativity and you do know the difference between right and wrong. the fact you are ignoring is that you are choosing the life you have. because it is a choice, you can choose a different path.since you haven\\u2019t been able to pull yourself out of this hole on your own, i hope you will make an appointment with a therapist. therapy will help you stop the ruminating and start to put a better life in motion. cognitive-behavior therapy would probably be the most helpful.writing to us here at psychcentral was a very good start. it shows that you haven\\u2019t really given up on yourself. take that little indication of self-respect another step. get yourself the help you need and, yes, deserve.i wish you well.\",\n          \"you are not to blame for your father\\u2019s unfortunate and sad choice. a fight with a daughter is not enough for a person to end his own life. my guess is that he was dealing with a great many things and felt helpless to change them.often people like those in your family blame someone because it is just too, too hard to accept that they didn\\u2019t see it coming and they hadn\\u2019t helped. when a tragedy happens, people cast about for a way to make sense of it. they may not, in fact, have had any more to do with your dad\\u2019s suicide than you did, but they may be fending off feelings of responsibility and self-blame by blaming you.i suggest you contact a women\\u2019s center. often women\\u2019s centers have a resource and referral office that helps people connect with services they need. the center itself may have support groups running. another avenue for support is the communities of faith in your area. it may be that one of the religious leaders is open to providing counseling for someone who can\\u2019t afford to pay for therapy. sometimes hospitals offer grief groups too. when i did a web search for grief groups in your area, i found quite a few. ask your doctor if she or he knows of any services as well.i hope you find a group. the support of other people who know how you feel will give you some relief. eventually, i hope the family gets some family therapy so they can stop making you the focus of their grief and you can feel comfortable in family gatherings.i wish you well.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
